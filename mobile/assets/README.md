# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following image files:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px recommended)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (optional)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon foreground (optional)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (optional)

## Quick Setup

You can use online tools to generate these assets:
- https://expo-assets-generator.vercel.app/
- https://shipmobilefast.com/asset-generator

Or create them manually. The app will work without these files, but you'll see warnings in development.
